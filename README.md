Colin Thomas - 
  I spent most of this summer working. I go around installing networking stuff like security cameras and wireless access points. When I wasn't working I did some fun projects with microcontrollers. I specifically wanted to look in to operating systems made for microcontrollers. I learned a lot about the theory behind operating systems. This lead me to looking in to linux kernel development. The idea that anyone can submit patches to the linux kernel is pretty cool and I'd like to do it eventually. <br />
Duan Rollins -
 I spent most of the summer working as well. I worked for my local Walmart Neighborhood Market in Chicago, IL. I was working a lot to get a car for the upcoming school year and I succeeded in doing so. If I wasn't working, I would either be playing my Ps4 or spending time with my girlfriend; I would also be learning more about Web Developement so I can pursue a career into it. I really like web programming because you can do so much in terms of creativity.

Matthew Schrag - I spent most of the summer working at my local Culvers. As it turned out we had some of our busiest weeks since we opened this past summer so it was a fairly tiring job at times. Outside of work I took web programming online over the summer and did fairly well. My da is a web programmer so it was neat to lean about what he dose for a living. I also started to learn how to play the ocarina in my free time. I also finally started to work on getting my license after having a permit for a while.
