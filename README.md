# VersioningWithATeam


Colin Thomas - 
  I spent most of this summer working. I go around installing networking stuff like security cameras and wireless access points. When I wasn't working I did some fun projects with microcontrollers. I specifically wanted to look in to operating systems made for microcontrollers. I learned a lot about the theory behind operating systems. This lead me to loking in to linux kernel development. The idea that anyone can submit patches to the linux kernel is pretty cool and I'd like to do it eventually.
